# TATA-Comm-Datathon
Building a projection of the business potential for each of the 4000 regions for the next 15 months using time series forecasting techniques.

#Data-Provided:
Business potential data for 4000 key locations from 2013 till 2020 are identified. Currently,
this data is made available monthly for each of the 4000 locations. It can be
assumed that this data contains potential outliers, and some amount of exploratory data analysis
(EDA) would need to be performed.

Monthly data from 2013 to 2018 are used as training set, and using this training set business potential for next 15 months is forecasted using time series forecasting techniques such as ARIMA, SARIMAX and LSTM.
